TinDog Starting Files

This project is for a start-up website called TinDog, which is designed for dog owners to connect with other dog owners and their dogs. The code includes a number of different sections, each with their own HTML tags and CSS styles.

The first section is the "title" section, which includes a navigation bar, the title of the website, and a call-to-action for users to download the app. This section also includes a background image of an iPhone with the TinDog app displayed.

The second section is the "features" section, which includes three different feature boxes that highlight the main benefits of using TinDog. These benefits are easy-to-use, access to an elite clientele of dogs, and a guarantee to find a match or your money back.

The third section is the "testimonials" section, which includes a carousel of customer testimonials from dog owners who have successfully used TinDog to connect with other dogs.

The code includes links to external resources, including the Bootstrap CSS and JS libraries, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome. The code also includes a custom stylesheet, located in the "css/styles.css" file, which contains additional CSS styles for the website.
